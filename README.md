## What is it?
Memoments is a Chrome extension that lets people leave notes on any website they visit for people to find. Not only do you have a collection of the great corners of the internet youâ€™ve been to, but you can also check out the sites your friends thought were worth saving. The added touch is the chance of finding a serendipitous comment and connecting with people around the world who share your interests. Memoments helps make the internet a less isolating and more interconnected place.
